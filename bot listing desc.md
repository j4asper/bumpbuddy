# Bump Buddy
### A bot that helps your server grow, by reminding you to bump your server on Disboard!

We all want members, don't we? So it is obviously a bonus to add your server to a site like Disboard, but when you do that, you forget to bump your server all the time, loosing a couple of potential members every time. Invite Bump Buddy! Be reminded to bump, and gain members! [Disboard.org's bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=302050872383242240&scope=bot&permissions=19473) is required in order to get notified when the server can be bumped!
