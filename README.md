# [Bump Buddy](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/765598792535244820) - Not updated yet
### A bot that helps your server grow, by reminding you to bump your server on Disboard!

Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/RFMkhhx) if you need help with anything!

We all want members, don't we? So it is obviously a bonus to add your server to a site like Disboard, but when you do that, you forget to bump your server all the time, loosing a couple of members every time. Invite Bump Buddy! Be reminded to bump, and gain members! Disboard.org's bot is required in order to get notified when the server can be bumped!

## New!
- Bump Buddy **should** now be able to work on all servers even though the disboard bot language is different. Not all languages has been tested! Join the support server if it doesn't work.
- Now support @here and @everyone as bump reminder roles!
- Custom reminder embed message!

## Commands:
#### Setup
**Bump Channel** The channel BB will send reminders in: "bb setchannel #CHANNEL"  
**Bump Role** A role that BB will ping when the bump is ready, if you want to set the bump role as @here or @everyone you type it in without the @: "bb setrole @ROLE" and for fx. @everyone it's "bb setrole everyone"  
**Custom Reminder Message** Create your own text in the reminder message by using this command: "bb setmsg This is the embed Title | THis is the embed Description" Using | as a splitter between title and description. If you leave it out, only the description will be changed.
